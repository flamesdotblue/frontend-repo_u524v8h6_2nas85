    excerpt: 'A deep dive into materials, vibrations, and field serviceability for next-gen drones.',
    content:
      'Harsh environments demand materials that balance stiffness, weight, and repairability. We explore carbon fiber layups, arm isolation techniques, and field-repair strategies that keep airframes serviceable without compromising rigidity. Key topics include fastener selection, thread locking, and vibration damping.\\n\\nWe also share validation data from shaker tables and crash testing to help you decide when to prioritize modularity over mass efficiency.',
